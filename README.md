## How to Use the Save Game Editor
     
To use the save game editor, you will need to dump your game save with a save manager. For the 3DS version, you can use [JKSM], which is a homebrew application that can backup and restore your save files. For the other versions, you can use any save manager that works with your console or PC. Once you have dumped your save file, you will need to put it in your computer and launch the save game editor. The save game editor can open two types of files: 000.dat and 001.dat. These are the save data of the player 1 and player 2 respectively. You can find them in the folder where you dumped your save file. For example, if you used JKSM for the 3DS version, you can find them in YOURSDCARD:\JKSV\Saves\RESIDENT\_EVIL\_REVELATIONS\YourFolderName.
     
After opening your file, you will see a user interface with various options and tabs. You can edit your name, name color, level, BP (battle points), ammo, grenades, green herbs, current character, main Raid Mode weapons, weapon parts, stage ranks, character outfits, and more. You can also enable infinite ammo and green herbs for fun. To edit any value, just click on it and type the new value or select it from a drop-down menu. You can also use the hex editor to manually edit the hexadecimal values of your save file. When you are done editing, click on the Save button and inject your modified save file back to your console or PC using the same save manager you used before.
